essay = Create a function how_eligible(essay) in your editor file that returns 0 to 4, equal to the number of these four characters that the essay included (You are not counting the number of times each individual character occurs.  You are counting how many of the four are in the essay at least once.). As pair programmers, generate ideas for how to solve this problem, strategize, and then code and test iteratively.  Be sure to do a lot of testing.  The code below is just a small subset of the testing that should be done to make sure your code is working properly.
